// Area reserved for skills (so i wouldn't spam index.js)

/* Basically, i have the skill name for the person to type and he can choose a character to use the skill against. I always check Esquiva (Dodge) and Acerto (Precision)
to know if the skill will hit, and then i want to know about attack x defense.
if(dado_dano = 20) is my way of replicating critical strikes, where i just double the dice.
Skills have different rolls of dices and effects. One example is 'Preciso (Bullseye)', where if he hits the person with a result of 4 or plus, he will do extra damage.
Skills will also always spend MP, that's 'mp_gasta (spent_mp)'.
*/

/* Not all of those skills are 100% done without any mistakes or programmed on the most time-effective way.
